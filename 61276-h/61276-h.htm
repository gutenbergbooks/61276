<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>Dr. A. S. Alexander, the writer and compiler of “Horse Secrets,”
has had upward of 25 years’ experience in matters pertaining to agriculture,
horse breeding, veterinary science, press writing and teaching.
He was the author of the first stallion service legislation and inspection
regulation in America, the first law of the kind having been
written by him and enacted by the Wisconsin Legislature in 1905.
Similar legislation now is in force in some 16 other states, and it is
accomplishing much for the improvement of horse breeding.</p>

<p>Horse trading offers unusual opportunities and temptations for
sharp practises. Both buyer and seller equally need to be horse-wise
and alert. Dishonesty is discountenanced in the great horse markets,
but it is common among scalpers, “gyps” and small traders outside
of the recognized markets and is likely to be practised by either the
buyer or the seller.</p>

<p>The items published in these pages disclose many sharp practises
which, aside from their interest as facts not generally known, are
valuable as information for the man who would engage intelligently
in horse buying and selling.</p>

<p>The writer and publishers of this book desire to expose these
tricks, and to decry their practise in the markets and among outside
dealers and breeders. “Forewarned is forearmed,” and the information
here given will doubtless save many a man from loss, and
tend to make dishonesty less rife because less likely to succeed.</p>

<p>In mentioning the various tricks herein disclosed, the exact
methods have not been given in detail. We have no desire to instruct
readers so that they may “go and do likewise”; for the same
reason doses have not been given for the administration of the various
drugs and “dopes” used by tricksters.</p>

<p>The matter relating to the purchase of stallions should prove
specially interesting and valuable. It is a matter of general knowledge
among the initiated that stallions are frequently sold at excessive
prices to companies of farmers, and that “peddlers” of such
stallions are unscrupulous in their methods of obtaining signers to
the notes taken for the purchase of such horses. The facts published
with respect to this business should serve to warn farmers that they
are apt to be cheated in purchasing a stallion on the “company
plan,” and that it is always best, safest and most profitable to purchase
a stallion direct from a reputable breeder or importer, for by
so doing much money will be saved and the horse bought will be
much more likely to prove sound and suitable and to give satisfaction.</p>

<p>Dr. Alexander desires in this place to acknowledge his indebtedness
to the publishers of the various farm and stock papers from the
pages of which extracts have been taken.</p>

<h2 id="Horse_Feeding_Secrets">Horse Feeding Secrets.</h2>

<h3 id="heading1">Secret of Hand Raising a Foal.</h3>

<p>An orphan foal can be successfully raised on cows’ milk
if the work is intelligently and patiently conducted.
Mares’ milk is sweeter than cows’ milk, but less rich
in butter fat; therefore, in using cows’ milk for foal
feeding, choose that which is poor in butter fat—3
per cent. or thereabout—and sweeten it with sugar or
molasses. The latter sweetening has the advantage of acting
as a mild aperient.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the first milk (colostrum)
of the mare contains a purgative principle for the removal
of the meconium from the intestinal tract of the foal, and as
the orphan foal does not receive this natural cathartic it is
apt to suffer from constipation, which may prove fatal. To
prevent this inject into the rectum of the foal, twice daily
from birth, two or three ounces of warm water containing
one to two teaspoonfuls of glycerine, and continue this treatment
until the bowels have been moved freely.</p>

<p>A mixture of equal quantities of cream, molasses and
warm water also makes a good injection fluid for a young
foal, and some horsemen insert a small, thin tallow-dip candle
into the rectum for a like purpose.</p>

<p>At first the foal should be fed once an hour, but
gradually the times of feeding may be reduced in number.
Feed the milk blood warm, giving at first half a cupful at
each meal and with it three tablespoonfuls of lime water to
the pint of milk. The foal will take the milk readily from a
large rubber nipple fitted on the neck of a feeding bottle which
must be often well scalded. A kid glove thumb perforated
and fitted over the spout of a small teapot will do almost as
well as a rubber nipple and feeding bottle.</p>

<p>Hand-fed foals tend to scour. When such trouble starts
withhold two or more feeds of milk, and give one to four
tablespoonfuls of castor oil in milk, according to the severity
of the attack and the size of the foal, and repeat the dose every
time there is any derangement of the digestive organs.</p>

<p>Soon the foal may be fed but six times a day, then four
times, and in a few weeks it will freely take milk and lime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
water from a clean pail. At this stage sugar may be omitted
and the lime water be given only once a day. The secret of
success is to feed a little milk often and to keep all utensils
scrupulously sweet and clean. As soon as he will take to it,
the foal may be allowed to lick oatmeal in small quantities;
gradually increase the amount and add wheat bran. After
six weeks give a little sweet skim-milk in place of a part of
the new milk, and by increasing the amount day by day the
foal may at three months old take skim-milk entirely and
continue to drink it freely three or four times daily while
eating grass, grain and bran.</p>

<h3 id="heading2">Secret of Feeding Silage to Horses.</h3>

<p>It is commonly believed that corn silage cannot safely
or profitably be fed to horses. Investigation shows that this
belief is ill advised, for some horsemen feed silage successfully.</p>

<p>A noted Wisconsin breeder has used corn silage extensively
as a feed for horses as a part of the winter ration during
the past eighteen years. The number wintered each year
averages about 100. His method is as follows:</p>

<p>In making silage for horses the corn is allowed to stand
until nearly out of the milk, as better results have thus been
obtained than when it is cut greener. The silo is filled as
rapidly as possible, and when full is allowed to settle for four
or five days, when it is again filled. Care is taken to pack
the silage tightly around the walls.</p>

<p>The silo is opened about November 15th, when the herds
have been brought in from the pastures. Care is taken to
feed the horses lightly at first so that they may become
accustomed to the new food.</p>

<p>A large bin has been built, connecting with a room below
the doors of the silo. This bin is filled from time to time
with a mixture of four parts of hay and one of straw, cut
about 3 inches long, by being run through a silage machine.
The silage is always mixed with this cut hay and straw before
feeding. The proportions are about one to five of silage by
weight. By cutting the hay and straw, the amount wasted is
reduced to a minimum.</p>

<p>The corn is never taken out of the silo before it is ready
to be used. The entire top is removed each day to a depth
of about two inches. Any silage that is spoilt is thrown away.
The silage and hay-straw are mixed thoroughly by forking
over several times in the room, already referred to. By doing
this the horses do not obtain all the silage at one time. Any
grain that is fed is put in the manger with the silage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>The amount of ensilage fed to different horses varies with
the animal. It is found that no two horses eat the same
amount and they are never given more than they will eat.
The average amount fed will be stated in each case below.</p>

<p>Aged stallions, used for breeding purposes, receive during
the winter season about 24 pounds of silage per day. This
is divided into three feeds, morning, noon and night. Besides
this they are fed long hay and grain. During the breeding
season they do not get any silage, as it has been found that
if it is fed at that time there is difficulty in getting mares in
foal and in raising a large percentage of colts. The reason for
this is not known.</p>

<p>Two-year old stallions receive about 20 pounds of silage
per day with their other feed. Yearling stallions receive about
15 pounds, with grain and hay. Mares with foals receive about
20 pounds, and also grain and hay while the colts are sucking.
This is reduced to about 15 pounds, fed twice a day in the
stable, after the colts are weaned.</p>

<p>Mares and geldings, from one year up, run in a herd
together. They are fed morning and night about 15 pounds
per day. During the day, if weather permits, they are turned
out in a pasture and fed hay upon the ground.</p>

<p>Colts, soon after they have learned to eat grain, are fed
a little silage in the box stalls with their mothers. For this
purpose small feed boxes are put in each stall near the
mangers, where the mares eat. After being weaned the colts
are fed about 7 pounds of silage a day with the grain. Alfalfa
hay also is put in a rack in the yard, in which the colts are
turned out each day, and they eat as much of this as they
care for.</p>

<p>The ration fed is higher than a balanced ration. There
has never been any sickness resulting from the use of silage.
The animals always come through the winter in good breeding
condition and in proper shape to be turned on to pasture in
the spring.</p>

<h3 id="heading3">Secret of Fattening Drafters.</h3>

<p>The business of buying young draft horses and feeding
them off for the market has been profitably followed by many
farmers during the past ten years. The work requires skill
and experience and is thus described by Prof. W. J.
Kennedy, of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station: “In
one of the large horse-feeding establishments of the West
the following method is practised: The horses are purchased,
their teeth are floated and they are all put in the
barn and their feed increased gradually, as great care
must be taken for a few days to avoid colic. It seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
preferable to feed them grain about five times per day, due to
the fact that as the stomach of the horse is proportionately
smaller than the stomach of a cow, he needs his feed in smaller
quantities and more often. The hay is placed in racks so
that access may be had to it at all times. The horses are given
all the water they will drink twice a day. The daily practise
is as follows: Corn is given at 5 o’clock in the morning; water
at 7; the hay racks are filled at 9 o’clock, when the horses are
also given oats and bran, the proportion being two-thirds
bran and one-third oats. At 12 o’clock they are fed corn
again; at 3 in the afternoon oats and bran are given and the
hay racks are refilled; at 4 they are given a second watering, and
at 6 the final feed of corn is given. The proportion for each
horse when upon full feed is as follows: Corn from 10 to 14
ears to each feed; oats and bran, about 3 quarts per feed, making
in all from 30 to 40 ears of corn and 6 quarts of oats and
bran per horse per day. The horses are not given any exercise
from the time they are put in the barn until a few days before
they are to be shipped. As a substitute for exercise, and in
order to keep the blood in good order, thus preventing stocked
legs, Glauber’s salt is used.”</p>

<p>In some instances horses fed in this manner have made a
gain of 5½ pounds a day for a period of 50 to 100 days. One
horse gained 550 pounds in 100 days. In many instances from
12 to 20 horses have made an average daily gain of 3⅓ pounds
per day each for a period of 90 days.</p>

<h3 id="heading4">Secret of Feeding Molasses.</h3>

<p>The feeding of black strap molasses came into vogue
when the United States artillery and cavalry horses in Porto
Rico required “plumping up.” By free use of this readily
assimilated fattening food mixed with cut hay or grass, horses
that had run down to skin and bone and become covered
with harness sores quickly gained flesh and acquired sleek,
polished, sound hides so that their former drivers or riders
failed to recognize them. Although large quantities of molasses
were fed to each horse daily, neither colic nor scouring was
caused.</p>

<p>Dr. W. H. Dalrymple, veterinarian of the Louisiana
Experiment Station, says that the amount of molasses fed
to the large sugar-mules of 42 plantations in his state is from
8 to 12 pounds per head per diem, or an average of about 9.5
pounds; a gallon of black strap molasses weighing 12 pounds.
He advises that less than this should be given at first and
gradually increased as the animals get used to it, though he
adds: “We have not experienced any ill effects from feeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the amounts alluded to.” In fact, as high as 21 pounds per
day has been fed in Louisiana without any untoward results.
The molasses is mixed with concentrates and cut hay.</p>

<p>Here is a recommended formula for molasses feeding on
a lesser scale to working draft horses:</p>

<p>Molasses, 1 quart; water, 3 quarts; cut hay, 5 pounds;
corn-meal, 4 quarts; coarse bran, 2 pints. Feed morning and
night. Give usual quantity of oats at noon, and add long
hay at night.</p>

<p>The Department of Agriculture, in Farmer’s Bulletin No.
107, states that molasses is an excellent food for horses and
cattle. It produces energy, maintains the vital heat, stimulates
the appetite and increases the digestibility of the other constituents
of the ration. That cane molasses is a satisfactory
substitute for starchy foods, being readily digested and
transformed into work: that 5 quarts of molasses can be
given daily to a 1,270 pound horse with advantage to its
health and the efficiency of its work.</p>

<h3 id="heading5">Secret of Stopping Halter Pulling.</h3>

<p>There are many different ways of managing halter pullers
and of these the following methods seem most effective:</p>

<p>Take a strong but thin rope about 20 feet long. Put the
middle of it under the horse’s tail like a crupper. Bring the
two ends forward along the back, knotting them together at
the loins and withers. Then pass one on each side of the neck,
through the ring of the halter and tie to the manger along
with the halter shank.</p>

<p>Pass the end of tie rope or halter over the manger
and tie it to one fore foot, so that the pull is equal on the
head and foot. This is simple, safe and efficient.</p>

<p>Put a good strong halter on the horse with a rope that
he cannot break; then put him either on a plank floor that is
about 4 inches higher behind than in front, or on a hard
earth floor of the same slope. Have the floor very smooth,
and wet it a little to make it slippery, if he is a bad one, and
pad the sides of the stall with old sacks or blankets, tying them
on with binder twine. As soon as the horse finds that he
cannot keep his feet he will give up pulling.</p>

<p>Use a good halter and 10 or 12 feet of strong rope or
strap. Tie one end of the rope around the pastern of a front
foot and pass the other end through the halter ring and fasten
to a stout post or manger and let the horse pull. This will
cure an ordinary case. If it does not cure a bad one, tie the
rope to a hind leg, passing it through the halter ring and
between the fore legs to the hind pastern.</p>

<p>Tie a rope around the hind leg at the pastern and pass
the rope to the opposite side of the body; run it around the
neck where the collar rests and tie the foot up so that it will
not touch the floor. Put a good halter on the horse and he
will not pull very hard.</p>

<p>Mr. J. S. Teesdale, of Multnomah County, Oregon,
contributed the following amusing account of the curing of
a halter puller to the Breeders’ Gazette: “I owned a horse
that pulled back every time he was tied up in or out of his
stable. I got very tired of it. I took him one day to a wharf
over a river. There was, as is usual, a wall on the dock a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
few feet from its edge. I led him on so that his face was
near the wall and his tail toward the water; and I stood him
with his right side close up to a partition that ran from the
wall to the edge of the wharf. I stood with my body close
to his left eye, hiding the river from his view, so that he could
not see the water from either side. The river was a very
silent one. I held him in that position almost an hour until
I thought he had forgotten the river entirely, then I tied
him to a ring in the wall, holding a sharp knife in my teeth
as I did so. As soon as I had tied him he hung back as
badly as ever. I cut the rope. He turned a back somersault
and dropped 10 feet into the river. When he came to the
surface and recovered from his daze, he swam down stream
to the end of the dock and landed. He never hung back again
so far as I know, although he was tied a thousand times.”</p>

<h3 id="heading6">Secret of Preventing Mules from Kicking.</h3>

<p>Mr. F. M. Walker, of Vernon County, Missouri, contributed
the following to the columns of the Breeders’ Gazette:
“Take two straps 1½ inches wide with a good ring; have the
straps long enough to buckle around the hind legs, one above
the hock and one below. First buckle the ring in both straps;
then take a stout rope, put a ring in the rope, and tie it
around the breast of the collar so that the double will come
back behind the belly-band and make the ring stay. Now
take another piece of stout rope, tie in the ring on the hind leg,
bring it up through ring at the belly-band and back to the
other ring on the hind leg. Do not leave any slack for the
horse or mule to get his feet over. An animal can walk or
trot in this rigging, but he cannot kick. I have broken several
mules in this way.”</p>

<h3 id="heading7">Tying a Mare With a Foal.</h3>

<p>To tie a mare so that her foal will not get hung in the
halter strap, use a ring in the manger instead of a hole. Thirty
inches is plenty long enough for the stale. Put a weight on
end of the stale—an old bar shoe will do all right. All good
horses in Great Britain are tied this way, except that the chain
is used.</p>

<h3 id="heading8">Secret of Handling a Balky Horse.</h3>

<p>A tired, balky horse is less apt to balk than one fresh
from the stable, and such horses are oftentimes kept in harness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
right up to the time of sale. This is a “David Harum” trick
and well worth remembering. Also, when a horse balks, be
careful to examine his shoulders. Soreness of the skin may
be the cause. It is a trick of the “gyps” secretly to bathe the
shoulders of a horse with an irritating solution which in 12
hours or less makes the animal refuse to pull in harness. They
do this with horses on which they purpose making a bid the
following day in the hope that when the victim balks the
owner will become disgusted and discount the price. Some
horses balk when worked in single harness but go all right
when hitched double. Chloroform is sometimes used to make
a balky horse stupid, so that he will forget to balk.</p>

<p>Kindness, petting, coaxing with a lump of sugar, carrot,
apple or other dainty sometimes succeeds with a balky horse
when harsh measures fail. Cruel procedures should be discountenanced
and punished and among these the worst trick,
perhaps, is to start a fire of paper, straw or brush under the
balker. Sometimes all that is necessary is to distract the
animal’s attention by pounding lightly with a stone on the
shoe of a fore foot, by tying a cord around the leg under the
knee, or by holding up one foot for a few minutes.</p>

<p>When a horse balks, one way of curing him is to remove
the harness, put on a halter, pull his head around to his side
and tie the halter rope in a slip-knot to a strand or two of the
tail hair, so as to keep the head well toward the tail. Then
he is forced to walk around in a circle until he staggers and
is ready to drop, when the rope may be loosed and the horse
will be likely to behave and remember the lesson for some time.</p>

<p>Some horses balk by lying down and refusing to budge.
If the four feet of such a sulker are “hog-tied” together and he
is abandoned and allowed to remain tied for an hour or two,
he will usually be thankful to get up and go on when set
at liberty.</p>

<p>One owner broke a balker by working him on a mower
for a few days with his tail tied to the singletree tight enough
to take part of the strain. After that he would pull by the
tugs without having his tail tied.</p>

<p>The “guy rope” plan is sometimes effective. A small rope
is tied around the horse’s neck and a half hitch taken with
it on his lower jaw. A husky man then pulls steadily upon
the rope and the horse will usually start forward with a lunge.
If not a confirmed old balker he may give up the standing
habit if treated in this way a few times.</p>

<p>Light, rapid switching across the nose with a light whip
sometimes starts a balker, but severe whipping has an opposite
effect.</p>

<p>The writer once was called to see a draft work-mare
that was “down” in an Irish teamster’s yard and refused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
get up. The poor brute was surrounded with whips and sticks
that had been broken over her back, and her body was covered
with welts from the whipping. The neighbors thronged
around to see what would happen when the “Doctor” tried
his hand at a job which had baffled their attempts. Examination
of the pulse showed a normal condition and the membranes
of the eyes gave no indication of sickness. After the
mare’s head and neck had been patted and stroked for a few
minutes, and she had been spoken to kindly and gently, she
got up at once when the halter was pulled upon and the word
of command given. Then she followed the veterinarian about
the yard like a dog, recognizing him as her only friend, and
ever since that teamster has said, “Sure that mon has the
power iv healin’ in his hands!” Whereas, the abused mare
only needed and wanted a little kindness and coaxing.</p>

<p>Here is a cure for balking recommended by E. A. Gerrard:
“In order to break a balky horse it is necessary to have
the appliances, though the first requirement is a cool head.
Next you will want a steady horse to hitch with the balky
one, together with a strong hopple strap, a rope and a covered
swivel pulley, and a good harness and wagon with a long
tongue, though one of ordinary length will do.</p>

<p>Fasten your pulley on the end of the tongue so that it
will work free; put the hopple on the balky horse’s hind ankle,
next to the tongue, and tie the rope in the hopple ring. Now
run it through the belly-band, up through the pulley and back
to the end of the doubletree on the side of the balky horse,
and tie it fast. See that your horses are standing even, making
the rope snug, so that the horse can stand easy. Take off
your stay chains, sever the line from the terrets on the balky
horse, get into the wagon, gather your lines so that you can
have control, keep cool, and wait half a minute; then speak to
the team and start the steady horse. As he starts he pulls
his end of the doubletree forward and draws on the wagon, the
other end of the doubletree going back, pulling the rope through
the pulley and lifting the balky horse’s foot. He tries to put
his foot down and in doing so he takes a step.</p>

<p>Say, ‘whoa!’ and stop your steady horse. Do not let the
balky horse make more than one step. Now sit still for half
a minute, then start again, stopping as soon as the first step
is made, by the same process. Sit still for another half minute,
then repeat. Each time you will have taught your horse that
when you told him to go he had to step.</p>

<p>Now if you are a horseman get down, go to your horse’s
head, pat his neck, tell him he is doing well and that he will
be the best pulling horse on the place. Then try him again.
If he is very anxious to go at the word, let him make six or
eight steps, then stop and sit quiet for half a minute. Gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
increase the distance you allow them to go each time, not
forgetting to stop long enough to allay any excitement before
starting again. When you have driven half a mile be sure
you are back at the stable, take your horse out, have a bottle
of strong borax water at hand and bathe his ankle for five
minutes where the hopple rubbed it.</p>

<p>On the next day hitch up with the balker on the other
side of the tongue. With most balky horses two lessons
will prove enough; often one will answer. But if the horse
is old he may forget in two or three weeks, if rested much,
so you will need to keep your appliances ready and put them
on at the first sign of balking.</p>

<p>There is little danger of a horse forgetting if he is worked
with the same mate and driver; therefore if you want a perfect
job you will do well to change the driver and the mate while
the lesson is fresh.”</p>

<p>Mr. F. H. Osburn, of Benton County, Indiana, is the
author of the following method of handling a balky mare:</p>

<p>“I had a good true horse to put beside this mare, one
which I knew could pull two such as she. Then instead of
putting a stay chain to my true horse I put on what I call a
stay rope, looping it around the balky mare’s tail, drawing
it up short and tying it to the other horse’s hame ring. Whenever
I spoke to my true puller something else had to come
although the balky mare was not very hasty to respond for
the first few lessons. We now have her convinced and I
drive her single, ride her when driving cattle, can use the
cattle whip over her, and she pays no attention to it. At
times she runs idle for a week or ten days, but she never gives
me a minute’s bother when I use her again.”</p>

<h3 id="heading9">Secret of Curing a Stall Kicker.</h3>

<p>Various methods have been proposed from time to time
for stopping a horse from kicking in the stall. Here are
several gleaned from various sources:</p>

<p>Strap a piece of chain, about 18 inches to 2 feet in length,
to the horse’s pastern so that it will fly back and hit him
each time he kicks. A trace or stay chain will do.</p>

<p>Pad the sides of the stall thickly with hay or straw kept
in place by sacking. When the horse kicks at this and does
not hear the sound of his foot striking the boards, he will be
scared and quit kicking.</p>

<p>Buckle a leather surcingle around the horse’s body back
of the fore legs and to it fasten a small double pulley placed
under the belly. Now place straps with buckles on them on
each of his legs below the fetlock joint, having a ring in each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
strap. Take ½ inch rope, tie to the ring on one front foot,
run it up through the pulley, back to the hind foot on the
opposite side and tie, then do the same with the opposite feet.
Leave the rope long enough for the animal to step. When
an attempt is made to kick, the pulley raises the front feet.
Use this in the stable until the kicking habit is cured.</p>

<p>To cure a barn kicker pack an ordinary grain bag tight
with hay or straw and suspend it from top of the stall by a
rope or strap, so that it will swing free from the side of the
stall and near the place the horse strikes the boards when he
kicks. When kicked the bag will swing back and hit the horse
on its return trip, and he will climb into the hay mow, if he
can. If the horse kicks with both feet, hang a bag on each side.</p>

<p>Tie the kicking horse between swinging partitions
whether in a single or box stall. The partition kicks back
each time it is kicked by the horse.</p>

<p>An “Old Timer” writing in the Breeders’ Gazette, suggests
the following plan for a pregnant mare that is a bad
kicker:</p>

<p>“Have a collar made of 1½ inch first-class heavy harness
leather, long enough to go around the mare’s neck at the
point where the collar fits, with 1¾ inch ring at the breast,
then get a strap 1½ inches wide, the full length of a side of
harness leather, cut tapering to 1 inch or less at the tip of
the light end, with 1¾ inch ring in the other. Then get a
2½ inch strap just long enough to go around the pastern of
the hind foot with ¾ inch ring in each end. Have the edges
of this strap slightly champered. Slip the collar on the mare’s
neck, put the short strap around the pastern of the left hind
foot, the thin long strap through the rings on the pastern,
then through the ring on the end of the long strap, and slip
up snug and tight: next, run the strap between the fore legs
and through the ring in the collar on the neck. Now draw
it up snug when she is standing in her natural position and
secure it with a slip-knot so that it can be easily removed
when necessary.</p>

<p>There will be no excitement about this, and no punishment.
It does not interfere with the mare’s lying down or
getting up; all it will do for her will be to prevent her from
kicking, simply because she cannot, and she will soon learn
to live in peace with her stable mates. We have used this
for many years without a failure, and we would be pleased
to have all humane horsemen use it in preference to a long
chain or heavy swinging block or padded stall.”</p>

<h2 id="Secret_Tricks_in_Horse_Trading">Secret Tricks in Horse Trading.</h2>

<h3 id="heading10">Secret of Shutting a Heaver.</h3>

<p>Heaves or broken wind more commonly perhaps than any
other unsoundness, offers opportunity and necessity for
skilful handling by the trickster in horse dealing. There are
numerous plans for the temporary relief of this disease, and
so skilfully is the work done that often it is not suspected
or discovered under twenty-four hours following a purchase.
The “patient” receives no bulky food and all feed is wetted.
Sometimes ammonia water is used in sprinkling the hay, and the
observant buyer may detect this by the odor. Lime water or
a solution of baking soda also is frequently used. An
examination of the bit may show that it has been “medicated”;
and allowing the horse to drink all the water he wants will be
likely to disclose the heaves when he is made to gallop or pull
a load. A pint of whiskey well diluted with water given as
a drench also will be likely quickly to offset the effect of drugs.</p>

<p>It is not the province of this book to furnish formulæ of
the mixtures or medicines used to “dope” or “shut” heavey
horses, but rather to put the buyer on his guard so that forewarned
he may be forearmed. Therefore, the following
“dopes” employed for dishonest purposes are mentioned:</p>

<p>Arsenic, stramonium, lobelia, indigo, chloral hydrate,
opium, melted lard, lead shot, raw eggs, milk, fresh ox blood,
vinegar, kerosene, slaked lime in drinking water, etc., and in
olden days a fistulous opening was made in connection with
the rectum for the free and silent passage of gas.</p>

<p>If the buyer is allowed twenty-four hours in which to
reject a horse, heaves, if present, will usually show up in that
time if the horse is given an abundance of drinking water and
bulky food and then is put to work.</p>

<h3 id="heading11">Secret of Plugging a Roarer.</h3>

<p>It is well to examine the horse’s nostrils when making a
purchase, otherwise he may sneeze out one or more sponges
on arriving at his new home. The sponges are inserted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
prevent a “roarer” from making a noise when breathing. This
is also accomplished by fastening a spring truss to the nose
band of the bridle in such a way that it causes pressure upon
the false nostrils and so lessens the intake of air when the
horse is in motion.</p>

<p>Sponges even of fine quality clog with mucus if left in
place too long. Dealers tie fine cords to the sponges and
by this means pull them out of the nostrils as soon as the
horse is sold. Another plan is to cut off the ends of a lemon,
squeeze it dry and then insert it in the nostril. It is left there
with impunity as it will soon dry out, shrivel and be sneezed
out of the nostril.</p>

<p>Another trick is to pack the horse’s sheath with oakum
to prevent unpleasant noises when he is trotting; and the
vagina of a lacerated (gill flirt) mare may be similarly treated
for a like reason. Laceration of the perineum, an accident
occurring at parturition, is usually incurable, hence the importance
of making a careful examination when buying a mare.</p>

<h3 id="heading12">Diamond Cut Diamond.</h3>

<p>It is not always at the time of making a sale that the
“gyp” practises sharp tricks. When occasion offers he has
been known purposely to depreciate the value of a horse he
wishes to buy. If he can make it appear that the horse is
lame, sick, broken-winded, weak eyed or balky he may acquire
him at a discount, and he has secret methods of accomplishing
his dishonest ends. A fine wire or cord tied around the
pastern soon causes symptoms simulating those of founder;
or the horse limps painfully after a horse-hair has by means
of a needle been passed through a certain part of his leg, or
when a small nail has been driven into the foot or a gravel
or bean put under the shoe. A horse will stop eating and so
appear sick when tallow has been smeared upon the roof of
the mouth and inner side of the upper incisor teeth; or refuse
to pull when his shoulders and breast have been bathed with
an irritating solution of corrosive sublimate, tincture of
cantharides, or tartar emetic; or seem to have glanders when
fresh butter has been melted and poured in his ears; or
afflicted with eye disease when whole flaxseed has been
chewed and rubbed on the eyes; or he can be made fractious
by an application of a caustic fluid.</p>

<p>The owner should make a careful search for such
causes of unsoundness should his horse mysteriously go
wrong at the time when a trade is pending, and on recognizing
the possibility of a trick it is better to call the deal off
than to discount the price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading13">Making a Horse Act Mean.</h3>

<p>When a “gyp” dealer learns that a farmer is having
difficulty in training a high-strung young horse, he tries to
buy him at a discount, and unless closely watched will try
to make the horse act mean when examined. He asks the
owner to harness or ride the horse, and diverting his attention
for a moment, applies an irritating substance to the heels,
or some other part of the animal, causing him to kick, plunge
and attempt to run away. He calls his secret dope “dog water,”
“hop-up,” “soup” or “fog,” and its effect is intended so to
disgust the horse owner that he will be glad to sell the fractious
beast at a bargain.</p>

<p>Often, should a buyer visit a scalper’s stable in the city,
he will be shown a fine-looking horse and attractive harness
and wagon. The price asked for the horse and outfit is a low
one, and the stranger jumps at the chance to acquire the
property; but just as the horse is being hitched up, he begins
to kick or behave badly under the influence of a dose of “soup.”
The intending buyer immediately suffers from “cold feet,”
and is readily induced to take an inferior horse. The fine horse
and outfit are thus used times without number to attract
buyers and assist in the sale of unattractive, cheap horses at
profitable prices.</p>

<h3 id="heading14">Blowing Air Under the Skin.</h3>

<p>When the muscles of the shoulder have wasted away,
constituting the condition termed “sweeny,” air sometimes is
blown under the skin to give the part a plump condition. This
trick is easily detected, for when the hand is passed over the
inflated part it crackles (crepitates) showing the presence of air
under the skin (emphysema). The same trick is practised to
make an old horse appear younger than he really is, the
hollow’s over the eyes being blown up by means of a hollow
needle, quill or straw passed through the skin. For low hip
and atrophy of the shoulder muscles we have also known
tricksters to inject a two per cent solution of phenol under
the skin and then thoroughly massage the part.</p>

<h3 id="heading15">Stopping a Switcher.</h3>

<p>Apart from operating upon the muscles of the tail to prevent
switching, which often is a bad vice in mares, dealers resort
to the following trick: The tail is tied up over the horse’s
back as tightly as possible and left in that position over night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
It becomes so numbed by this treatment that the horse is
unable to use it for half a day or so after it is let down.</p>

<p>The switching habit is also mechanically prevented, when
the mare is hitched, by fastening a strand of the hair or string
from each side of the tail to a part of the breeching of harness.</p>

<p>Tail switching is less likely to be noticed by the buyer if
the tail is tied up or braided. Therefore, it is well to let the
tail down for this and other reasons before deciding to buy
the horse.</p>

<h3 id="heading16">The Turpentine and Gasoline Tricks.</h3>

<p>Temporarily to lessen or remedy the lameness of a footsore
horse, turpentine heated to the boiling point is poured
into the sole of the foot. It can be held there for five minutes
by binding a bandage around the foot so that the turpentine
cannot run down over the hoof-head. The buyer may readily
detect this trick, as the odor of turpentine gives it away when
the hoof is examined.</p>

<p>It also is alleged that the following treatment is given for
muscle soreness, caused by use over hard stones: The night
before he wishes to sell the horse affected in this way, the
“gyp” dealer will pour gasoline over the withers, and let it
flow down both shoulders and forearms. The gasoline contracts
the capillaries and larger blood vessels and diminishes
the blood pressure and nerve sensibility, thus allowing a nearly
natural movement of the muscles. Of course as soon as the
effect of the gasoline passes away the soreness will return. If
gasoline were rubbed on the muscles it would probably result
in a blister.</p>

<h3 id="heading17">Gingering a Show Horse.</h3>

<p>As a preparation for the show ring contest, or before
exhibiting a horse to a prospective buyer, it is almost the
general practise to insert ginger root in the animal’s rectum
that the irritation produced thereby may cause it to carry
a high tail and show spirit and action.</p>

<p>While this objectionable practise obtains most as regards
coach and carriage horses, it is also followed by exhibitors
and sellers of draft stallions and mares, and of recent years
has been practised extensively. Indeed the trick is becoming
far too common, and we have even seen it boldly and flagrantly
practised in the judging ring to the disgust of all decent
and fair-minded spectators. Possibly there may be some
excuse for the practise as a means of setting a show or sale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
horse “on edge,” but if allowed at all it should at least be
done in private and be absolutely prohibited as a public act
in the show ring. We sincerely trust that managers of horse
shows will take this view of the matter; and officers of the
humane societies should see to it that horses are not excessively
tortured in this way. While the grooms of some horse
exhibitors use ginger in the judging ring, others pay some
regard to the rules of decency by backing the horses into
their stalls before showing so that the trick may be practised
unnoticed by the visitors who throng the aisles of the horse
barns. We have heard of such a plan being followed when
preparing the entire string of coach horses of one owner for the
evening exhibit at a great horse show.</p>

<h3 id="heading18">Unnerving and Cocaining.</h3>

<p>Chronic lameness is done away with by skilful obliteration
of the large nerves which supply the affected parts with
sensation. The operation is termed nerving or unnerving in
common parlance and, properly, as neurectomy. It consists
in cutting down upon the nerve and then removing a portion
so that its function is destroyed so far as the portion below
the seat of operation is concerned. Unnerving is most often
done to hide the lameness caused by navicular disease which is
incurable: it may also be practised on account of ringbone, side-bone,
founder or other unsoundness of the foot. After
unnerving the horse does not evince pain when the parts
below the seat of the operation are pinched or pricked. The
operation merely does away with pain and lameness. It is
in no way a cure.</p>

<p>Cocaine or eucaine solution injected by means of a hypodermic
syringe upon the nerves at the points where neurectomy
would be performed will temporarily have an effect like
that of the operation. Just after the injection a swollen or
puffed place may be discovered at the point where the
hypodermic needle was inserted, and local soreness may be
present after the effects of the drug have subsided.</p>

<h3 id="heading19">Keep an Eye on the Sign-Board.</h3>

<p>Dr. Hawley advises that when buying horses at auction
one should watch the sign-board, as it may be suddenly
shifted from “serviceably sound” to “wind and work.” In such
a case a horse slightly lame may be purchased with no chance
of rejection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading20">Secret of Hiding a Spavin.</h3>

<p>It is an old “gyp” trick to beat one hock-joint with a
stick so that it will swell and acquire the same size as the
hock unsound from spavin. Caustic solutions injected under
the skin at the seat of spavin also smooth the appearance of
the joint.</p>

<p>If spavin is suspected, test for it by picking up the hind
foot and holding it toward the stifle for two or three minutes
so as to tightly shut the hock-joint. Then drop the foot and
instantly have the horse trotted. If spavin, apparent or hidden
(occult), is present the horse will hop off on three legs, or go
much lamer than before.</p>

<h3 id="heading21">Artificially Induced Knee Action.</h3>

<p>True knee action is an inborn trait in certain horses,
such as those of the English hackney breed, and some families
of American trotters; but in many high-stepping horses, sold on
the market, such action is unnatural, and has been acquired. The
true knee actor flexes his hocks about as freely as he does his
knees. This is the test: Watch a fashionable, high-going
coacher, and if the action is not well balanced, and if the hind
legs are imperfectly flexed, and seem to have difficulty in
“keeping up with the procession,” depend upon it that the
horse has been trained to go as he does and easily may forget
his lessons on leaving school.</p>

<p>The “gyp” trick is to wet the hoof heads with turpentine,
which sets up intense irritation and induces knee action. This
is readily discovered by remembering to run the hands over
the coronets when examining the horse, then noting if they
smell of any drug.</p>

<p>The horse trainer, on the other hand, develops high knee
action by putting on heavy shoes, the toes being left long;
by trotting and galloping the horse in plowed land, deep snow,
or a deep bed of straw. He also frequently taps the legs
back of the knees with a whip or light stick as the horse takes
daily walking exercise. Soon the animal learns the trick of
high stepping, and thus is ready to match with one of like
kind and gait, for sale at a high figure to some rich man in
the city.</p>

<p>A coach horse with extraordinary high knee action was
sold by a dealer to a city man for $400. In a few days the
buyer returned the horse saying, “Sell him over again; you
put him on me, now stick some one else with him.” This
horse had stringhalt in both fore legs which caused him to
go high.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>In buying a coach or hackney stallion or mare for breeding
purposes, see to it that the high action is natural and not
acquired or due to chorea, else the tendency to step high will
not be transmitted to the progeny.</p>

<h3 id="heading22">The Artificial Tail Trick.</h3>

<p>Where a horse is bought without careful examination of
the tail, it may transpire when too late for redress that the
switching appendage has been joined on. We remember
examining a fine, thoroughbred running horse that was to be
used for saddle purposes. Everything passed scrutiny until
we came to the tail, which was that of some other horse,
nicely held in place by clamps. When it was removed it was
found that the horse under examination possessed a mere
vestigial stump of a tail—a regular shaving brush affair—and
on that account the deal, like the tail, was all off.</p>

<p>Draft and work horses are often offered with the tail
braided and tied up. Where this is the case, the intending
buyer should let the tail down and then he may find that a
big foreign switch has been braided in with the scant supply
of natural hair.</p>

<p>The critical examination of the tail will also save the
prospective purchaser from acquiring an animal afflicted with
pigment tumors (<a href="#Page_48">see page 48</a>), or one that is about to lose
a portion of the tail by gangrene, due to keeping a cord too
tightly and too long around the part when tied up in muddy
weather, or while exposed for sale.</p>

<h3 id="heading23">Keeping a Horse “In the Air.”</h3>

<p>The dealer tries to keep a horse “in the air” as much as
possible when showing him to a prospective buyer, but the
latter should be sure to examine the horse when he is “standing
at ease.” The object of keeping the horse rattled by
cracking whips, shaking barn door latches, rattling a whip
handle inside of a derby hat, whooping, yelling, and chasing
behind him, is to make him appear spirited, or to hide some
lameness. Often the horse so treated has a spavin, the laming
effects of which disappear with exercise, and this also is true
if the horse has navicular disease or chorea.</p>

<p>This absurd treatment of the horse is customary in the
selling of a heavy draft stallion that has been so fattened,
pampered and drugged that he is practically asleep half the
time, and has to be waked up by strenuous means to give him
an appearance of life. A naturally acute and wide-awake
horse needs little urging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading24">The Loose Shoe Trick.</h3>

<p>When a horse is a poor mover, but stylish and likely to
be a prize winner in the show ring, the owner tries to avoid
putting him through his paces before the judges. A shoe
is loosely tacked on, so that when the horse is trotted it
comes off, and the owner then blames imperfection of motion
to the loss of the shoe.</p>

<p>We remember a case in the judging ring where a stallion
with notoriously poor, flat, brittle hoofs was being trotted
out for inspection by the awarding committee. At the first
trot out, off flew the shoe, carrying with it a goodly portion of
horny wall. “Too bad, too bad!” condoled the judge with
the owner, who instantly replied, “Oh, that’s all right; a horse
with a foot like that will never miss it!” And the judge—a
beginner—seemed to take it for granted that the foot was a
specially good one, precisely as he was expected to do, and he
gave the horse a prize, although he had not been properly
shown out like his rivals.</p>

<h3 id="heading25">Wire Marks Over Side-Bones.</h3>

<p>Instances have been disclosed where gashes have purposely
been cut with a knife on the hoof head just over a
prominent side-bone so that when the wounds healed and left
large scars the side-bones might be laid to a wire cut. This
trick is mostly used in the case of a stallion that might, on
account of a side-bone, be refused a license for public service
in states where laws are in force for the supervision of the
horse breeding industry.</p>

<p>In Wisconsin, which was the first state to enact a stallion
service law, we found large scars over side-bones on both fore
feet of a pure-bred draft stallion. In another case, where a
complaint was filed to the effect that a stallion was unsound
from side-bone, the owner claimed by letter that the side-bone
was due to a calk wound. Examination by a veterinarian disclosed
the fact that the wound scar was over a side-bone on
a <i>hind</i> foot, and there were two large side-bones on each fore
foot and no scars on the latter. The state license of this
horse was promptly cancelled for cause.</p>

<h3 id="heading26">Wedging a Cribber.</h3>

<p>Some dealers temporarily make a horse desist from cribbing
by driving hard wood wedges between his front incisor
teeth. Another old plan is to saw between the teeth. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
soreness makes it painful for the horse to practise the habit
of cribbing. Such a horse may be returned to the commission
man, no matter how much time has elapsed since the purchase.
The trick is difficult to discover unless the horse has cribbed
long enough to render the appearance of the teeth suspicious.
In the confirmed cribber the teeth are worn off or levelled and
usually have lost the marks.</p>

<p>Another way of stopping a horse from cribbing is to blindfold
the animal, place a block of wood on the incisor teeth
and strike it with a mallet. By this cruel means the parts
are made so sore that the horse temporarily stops catching
hold of the manger to crib and suck wind.</p>

<p>The buyer should always, when possible, see the horse
in the stall prior to the show out. If he remembers this and
moves quick enough he may see the horse wearing a strap
buckled around his neck just back of the ears. Such a horse
is a cribber and wind-sucker and the strap is put on to prevent
the latter vice.</p>

<h3 id="heading27">Making an Artificial Star.</h3>

<p>It sometimes happens or is claimed to have happened that
a pure-bred foal, registered when young in the stud book,
is set down as having a star in its forehead but which on
attaining maturity shows no such mark. Sometimes in matching
horses a difficulty is experienced when a perfect mate is
found with the exception that a star is lacking.</p>

<p>In such cases the horseman is occasionally more or less
successful in producing an artificial star. One plan suggested
is to cut a boiling hot potato in two and instantly apply the
cut surface to the skin of the forehead. The scalding removes
the hair and it comes in white, but a careful examination of
such an artificial scar often will disclose a small pink, hairless
spot in the center of the mark. The same tell-tale spot is seen
where the artificial star has been produced by cauterizing with
a red-hot iron or scalding with boiling water. The discovery
of an artificial star on the forehead of a stallion or mare sold
as pure-bred and registered is sufficient reason for making
a careful investigation as to the identity of the animal and the
integrity of the seller.</p>

<p>An old book gives the following plan of making an
artificial star: Take a piece of coarse tow-linen, the size of
the wished-for star. Spread on it warm pitch, and apply it
to the shaved spot; leave it on for two or three days, then
wash with a smart water, or elixir of vitriol, two or three
times a day until well. When the hair grows it will be white.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading28">Black Spots on a White Horse.</h3>

<p>An old veterinary book says: Take of powdered quicklime
half a pound, and litharge four ounces. Beat well the
litharge with the lime. The above is to be put into a vessel
and a sharp lye is to be poured over it. This is the coloring
matter which must be applied to such parts of the animal as
you wish to have dyed black.</p>

<h3 id="heading29">Broken Crest or Wrong Lying Mane.</h3>

<p>In certain gross, coarse-necked, heavy-maned, plethoric
draft stallions advancing in age it is not uncommon to find
the crest broken over under the weight of the mane. Attempts
are sometimes made by the owner or seller to offset this objectionable
condition by braiding the mane and causing it to lie
upon the side of the neck opposite the break by weighting
with flat strips of lead attached to the hair. If the crest breaks
over to either side the mane may be roached. Weights may
also be used in similar fashion to shed the mane of one horse
of a pair so that it will lie on the proper side of the neck to
make the team well matched and dressed. A broken crest is
objectionable in a stallion as it indicates coarseness and grossness,
a tendency to which is likely to be transmitted. The
term broken crest is sometimes applied in the market to a
horse affected with fistulous withers or scarred therefrom.</p>

<h3 id="heading30">Concealing Discharging Sinuses.</h3>

<p>It is not uncommon for a horse to have a fistula (opening
or sinus) of a salivary duct. Where this is so there will be
a discharge of saliva which appears as a limpid, transparent
liquid oozing out or flowing in a stream. It is most profuse
when the animal is eating and at that time may escape in jets.</p>

<p>Such fistulæ commonly involve Stenon’s duct and are
located on the side of the face or jaw. They are difficult to
remedy, and the dealer resorts to the use of strong astringents
and then plugs the openings tightly with cotton to
temporarily prevent escape of saliva until a sale has been
effected.</p>

<p>A fistula connecting with the root of a diseased molar and
discharging pus through a sinus (pipe) the orifice of which
is under the lower jaw, may be plugged in similar fashion, to
be discovered later by the chagrined buyer. It also is possible
temporarily to prevent escape of pus from small chronic fistulæ
or those resulting from poll-evil, fistulous withers or trephining
of the bones of the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading31">The Galloping Past Dodge.</h3>

<p>Some horses roar loudly when going fast in harness, but
are instantly quiet when action ceases. To prevent the detection
of this unsoundness the seller, unless prevented from
doing so by an experienced buyer, gallops the horse past the
latter and, by tugging upon the lines, makes it appear that
the animal is trying to run away or is difficult to control. The
team is pulled up some distance away and by the time the
buyer gets there the horse has resumed normal breathing.</p>

<p>The better way to test the horse’s wind is to lock the rear
wheels of a wagon by thrusting a strong stick between the
spokes from one wheel to the other; then make the horses
pull the wagon at a run and be at their heads the moment they
stop. Such horses may not be true roarers but mechanical
chokers with thick, bull necks or enlarged throat glands.
These are practically sound and only roar when pulling a
heavy load up hill or on getting the chin down close to the
chest.</p>

<h3 id="heading32">Keeping a Horse on Edge.</h3>

<p>A horseman of the old school writes: “When dealers
have had a horse some time in their stables, they exercise
him with a whip two or three times a day, so that when a
‘chapman’ goes to look at him, they have only to stir their
hand with the whip in it. Under such conditions it is hard
to say whether the horse, fearful of a drubbing, is lame or not,
and a good judge may be deceived.”</p>

<p>In another place he says: “A horse that goes with his
fore feet low is very apt to stumble and there are some that
go so near the ground that they stumble most on even road,
and the dealers, to remedy this, put heavy shoes on their feet,
for the heavier a horse’s shoes are, the higher he will lift his
feet.”</p>

<h3 id="heading33">“An Eye for An Eye.”</h3>

<p>The buyer should have a keen look out for the eye of the
horse; otherwise he may easily make sad mistakes in the
market.</p>

<p>The pupil of the eye should contract when the horse
comes out into the light. If it does not, the eye is blind, or
at least unsound. Such eyes have an unnatural appearance
which should attract the attention of the alert examiner, but
he will be very apt to overlook the blindness if the horse is
led out into the bright sunshine. Where a horse has recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
become blind from periodic ophthalmia (moon blindness), he
may still be able to detect a bright light, and so when exposed
to sunshine, may throw up his head and look directly at the
sun. This act makes the examiner liable to consider the eyes
sound.</p>

<p>Periodic ophthalmia, as suggested by the term, comes on
at intervals, but eventually after repeated attacks ends in
blindness of one or both eyes.</p>

<p>A horse that has had a few attacks, causing a slight
opacity of the cornea (scum), is a favorite with the scalper, as
he can be bought cheap, treated for the temporary clearing
up of the eyes, and sold at a profit to an unwary buyer. The
disease is incurable, and its presence is to be suspected when
the eyebrow appears triangular and wrinkled, and the eye
looks smaller than its mate, or a healthy eye, and is retracted
into the orbit.</p>

<p>Unscrupulous buyers sometimes render a horse temporarily
blind by chewing whole flaxseed to a pulp and smearing it in
the eye. By washing a cloudy, sticky-looking eyeball, this
trick is readily discovered.</p>

<p>A horse may also be rendered temporarily blind by the
administration of certain drugs.</p>

<p>The clearing-up process of treating a blue-eyed or moon-blind
horse also is effected by skilful use of such drugs as
atropia, belladonna, eserine, nitrate of mercury ointment,
bloodroot, alum, calomel, etc. Their effect is transitory, and
the horse soon has an unmistakable attack of ophthalmia.</p>

<h3 id="heading34">Examine the Ears.</h3>

<p>It will be well to “put a flea in the ear” of the man who
contemplates buying a horse and who may not know that the
ear will bear investigation. If the animal will not submit to
inspection, look out! The horse that will not allow one to
handle his ears, or fights when the attempt is made, may be
a terror to shoe, and therefore has had the “twitch” put on
his ear many a time in the blacksmith’s shop; or he may
have had poll-evil, some injury to the ear, or head, or have
a disease present which makes the ear sore or sensitive. A
horse so affected is difficult to handle, as he fights when the
halter or bridle is put on.</p>

<p>Sometimes a fine silken thread may be found running
under the forelock from ear to ear to prevent them from
lopping over.</p>

<p>Or there may be a leaden bullet suspended by a silk
thread in the hollow of the ear to prevent its constant motion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Sometimes the motion indicates impaired sight or nervousness,
whereas the lack of it may indicate deafness.</p>

<p>Then, too, we sometimes find at the base of the ear a
chronic, almost incurable fistulous opening and tract connecting
with the bursa mucosa, constantly discharging a
substance like liquid vaseline, which daubs and mats the hair,
giving the part an untidy, filthy appearance.</p>

<p>Besides this, temporarily stitched and glued split ears,
chronic eczema and warts may be looked for and avoided. It
is more difficult to find ear ticks, such as are met with in
southwestern states, but when present they cause great irritation,
and may make a horse fractious.</p>

<h3 id="heading35">Bishoping, an Old Trick.</h3>

<p>John C. Knowlson,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> an old farrier, writing in 1850, says:
“Horse dealers have a trick of knocking out the nook teeth
at three years and a half, to make a horse appear five years
old when only four; but they cannot raise the tusks. At six
years old the nook teeth are a little hollow, and at seven there
is a black mark, like the end of a ripe bean. Afterwards you
will observe the flesh shrink from the teeth, which grow long
and yellow. Horse dealers have also a method which they
call <i>Bishoping a horse’s mouth</i>; that is, filing the tusks shorter,
rounding them at the ends, taking a little out of the nook
teeth, so as to make them rather hollow, and then burning
them with a hot iron. I was hired by Anthony Johnson, of
Wincolmlee, Hull, as farrier to a number of horses that were
going to the city of Moscow, in Russia, for sale, and we had
a little gray horse, called Peatum, that was seventeen years
old, the mouth of which I bishoped, and he passed for six
years old, and was the first horse sold, and for £500 English
money! I only mention this as a caution to horse buyers.”</p>

<h3 id="heading36">How Bishoping is Done.</h3>

<p>Bishoping is dental forgery, false marks being made on
the incisor teeth to make an old horse appear young. It is a
dishonest practise and not to be countenanced for a moment
by a reputable horseman. The modus operandi of the
business is told as follows in a well-known book on “Animal
Dentistry”: “Renewal of the cups (bishoping) is the most
important of the artificial attempts to make horses appear
younger, and if performed intelligently upon horses that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
not too old, together with the shortening and polishing of the
crowns of the superior incisors, may deceive even the vaunted
expert. The operation consists of cutting large cups in the
inferior corners, smaller ones in the laterals and mere dots
in the centrals and then staining them with silver nitrate.
The cupping process is performed with an engraver’s gouge,
and a revolving hand drill, or by the modern ingenious implement
in vogue in the Chicago market, consisting of the foot
engine used by human dentists, equipped with a circular
cutting wheel, by which cups of perfectly normal shape and
size can be made. The horse is backed into a single stall
and secured in a dental halter. An assistant works the dental
engine with the foot. The operator holding the hand piece of
the flexible shaft in the right hand and the jaw in the other,
cuts first a large elliptical cup, with sharp commissures, in
the table of the corner incisors, then smaller ones in the
laterals and small dots in the centrals. As the wheel revolves
with great velocity, the cupping is the work of but a moment,
if the horse stands complacently. When the corner tooth has
but a small table it is enlarged by filling and the cup is cut
across its entire length. The cup in the corners is frequently
made with a rounded belly internally and a sharp commissure
externally to give a more confusing if not a more natural
appearance. When the cupping process is complete, the
arcade is dried and kept free from saliva by wrapping the jaw
behind the teeth with a cloth or towel. The cups are then
stained by applying a saturated solution of silver nitrate with
a stick and then drying it immediately by plunging the head
of a burning match into it. The drying process immediately
blackens the cavity. If the stain flows over the table of the
tooth it is filed off.</p>

<p>Shortening, polishing, cupping and staining the incisor
teeth of a nine or ten-year-old horse may be so cleverly performed
that the most circumspect study of the mouth may fail
to detect the alteration. In these cases the cupping is limited
to the removal of the crusta petrosa within the infundibula,
thus leaving the cup with a perfect enamel boundary. At
that age the other retrogressive changes are not pronounced,
and afford but little evidence to guide the diagnostician.
When horses are past the age of twelve years the results of
these operations are easily detected by the interrupted contact
of the incisor arcades (rows of teeth) and especially by the
angle of inclination, which is never altered by any natural
process and which cannot be artificially changed. The shape
of the tables and the absence of enamel around the cup will
also lead readily to detection of the fraudulent attempts to
make very old horses appear younger.”</p>

<h2 id="Miscellaneous_Secrets">Miscellaneous Secrets.</h2>

<h3 id="heading37">The Widow Trick.</h3>

<p>Some years since it was common to find cunningly worded
horse-sale advertisements in the daily newspapers, offering
seemingly valuable animals at sacrifice prices. In some of these
advertisements it was stated that a widow about to leave for
Europe, where she hoped to be able to assuage the grief of her
recent bereavement, would sell her favorite carriage horse,
provided she could be assured of a good home and kind treatment
for the highly esteemed animal. In reality the widow
was a myth and the valuable horse a good looking, but
worthless “robber.”</p>

<p>The scheme was craftily carried out, and many a man
from the country fell a dupe to the wiles of the “widow” and
her confederates. On going to the address mentioned in the
advertisement, the prospective buyer would find a large stable
in the rear of a fine old-fashioned mansion on one of the outlying
boulevards or avenues. Here in charge of a glib-tongued
coachman, usually a colored man, would be found several
finely groomed horses standing knee deep in the finest of
wheat straw bedding and surrounded by every appointment
of a swell private stable. Opening negotiations with the
groom, the buyer would hear one of the most plausible and
pleasing tales imaginable elaborative of a similar, condensed
story told in the glowing advertisement that had induced the
visit. The filly or gelding would be described as bred in the
purple, by Allerton, out of Kentucky Queen, she by a Pilot
Jr., or some such combination of standard blood, possessed of
great speed, having done halves in 1.08, a final quarter in 34
seconds, and the half “would have been as good as 1.06¼ had
the track ‘near the pole’ not been heavy from a recent rain.”
When the purchaser had become interested, but not sufficiently
so to agree to a somewhat steep price, the “widow” dressed in
deepest mourning and heavily veiled would opportunely appear
upon the scene, do the weeping act and manage matters so
adroitly that soon a bargain would be struck at a handsome
figure.</p>

<p>Sometimes a “Colonel” or a “General” or a “Judge” would
take the place of the “widow,” the man posing as that character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
being suitably dressed for the part, commanding in appearance,
and so plausible and polished in address as to disarm
all suspicion. During the preliminary negotiations between the
groom and the buyer, the “General” would be conveniently
stationed in the hay-loft overhead and would be summoned
by electric bell when wanted, the “sucker” meanwhile being
taken into the alley to see the horse go through his paces.</p>

<p>Needless to say that the buyer on getting the horse home
and trying him out quickly rued his bargain, and equally
unnecessary to say that when he went back to the swell
stable for redress he found the place abandoned and was
wholly unable to locate the men who had perpetrated the
swindle.</p>

<p>This method of fleecing the unwary buyer is still in vogue
but far less common than was the case before the advent of
the automobile. Still it will be well to take glowing horse-sale
advertisements with a large grain of salt, and better still
to purchase a horse through some reliable commission man
or dealer.</p>

<h3 id="heading38">Landing a Sucker.</h3>

<p>Dr. H. W. Hawley, an experienced veterinary horse
buyer at the Chicago Stock Yards, says in the June, 1903,
number of the Chicago Veterinary College “Quarterly Bulletin,”
that most of the tricks of the horse dealing trade,
though not all of them, are performed by scalpers. It takes
only a few glances or questions for the sharper to know
just the sort of horse the city buyer is looking for, and the
scalper, with the aid of his colleagues, proceeds to “land a
sucker.”</p>

<p>The gentlemanly scalper, with a disinterested manner,
informs the buyer that he saw a lovely horse in a certain
barn, the color being mentioned, but not being a horseman
he knows nothing as to the soundness of the animal, nor as
to the price. Word is sent along the line, and everything
is ready. The horse is led out and just suits; is sound and
all right, but the sum asked is $25 to $75 more than the
market price. Perhaps the unsuspecting buyer will offer $10
or $15 more than the auction price, but he is allowed to go
away with a polite, “Thank you, for the offer.”</p>

<p>Another disinterested party whispers in the buyer’s ear
that the horse will be sold at auction. Sure enough, the animal
is led to the auction stables, and care is taken that the buyer
sees it passing.</p>

<p>The auctioneer and ringman are posted, and they wait
for the sucker. The horseman starts the animal at pretty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
near his value. The bidding is rapid. The sucker gets in,
and under excitement bids two or three times. Perhaps one
of the regular eastern shippers bids once, but as a rule, the
sucker, the auctioneer, and the scalper are the only bidders.
The latter can usually tell when the victim has made his last
bid, and the horse is knocked down to him at a good profit,
which is divided between those concerned.</p>

<p>Sometimes the auctioneer is fooled by the sucker refusing
to bid again. In such a case the scalper kicks out of his last
bid and the horse is sold to the sucker at his previous bid.</p>

<h3 id="heading39">A Horse That Was Right There.</h3>

<p>A New Hampshire horse dealer was “burned” by trading
for a horse that would work anywhere and pull strongly
except when he came to the foot of a hill; there he would balk
and refuse to pull a pound. After he had kept the horse about
a month a stranger came along and was “taken in.” The
horse looked well and a trade was made for another horse
and considerable “boot.” The buyer asked the dealer if the
horse was a good worker and was told, “You bet! He will
work any place you put him and when you come to the foot
of a hill I tell you <i>he’s right there</i>!”</p>

<p>So the buyer discovered, and on complaining bitterly
to the dealer was reminded of his honesty and candor in
stating that at the foot of a hill he would always be right
there. No doubt he paid more particular attention to the
plausible talk of the dealer the next time he had occasion to
“dicker” for a “hoss.”</p>

<h3 id="heading40">An Honest “Hoss” Dealer.</h3>

<p>There lived in Michigan a shrewd old horse dealer who
gave folks due warning to beware when he donned his selling
clothes. He used to say: “When I say, ‘Hoss’,—look out!
I’m a-goin’ to trade. But when it’s ‘Horse,’—nawthin’ doin’!
Ye’re perfectly safe.”</p>

<p>It is related that this character had a balky horse put on
him by brother dealers in a neighboring town; but a few days
later he got even, and with the same “hoss.” The former
owners failed to recognize the beast, for in the interim it had
been clipped, roached, docked and bishoped, besides receiving
a few artistic spots of dye, and having had “tug marks” and
“collar galls” manufactured by skilful shaving at the right
places. In his new fix he looked a young, handsome, hard-working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
animal, but when the deal was made and the new
owners hitched him up, they realized at once that both they
and the horse were “stuck.”</p>

<h3 id="heading41">A Sharper’s Smooth Sayings.</h3>

<p>Elsewhere we have told of a balker that “was right there
at the foot of a hill” or that would “stand without hitching.”
The scalper and crafty dealer use many catchy phrases of
this sort, and they fool the buyer unless he has sharp ears
and quick comprehension.</p>

<p>A few additional catch sayings may prove of interest: A
dealer having a horse with defective eyesight fitted him out
with close blinkers and said to the buyer, “He doesn’t look
very well.” Another said of a heavey horse, “If he ain’t windy
you needn’t take him.”</p>

<p>Again, as to looks, and ability in harness, one said, “If
he don’t suit you in harness you can take it off,” and again,
“Single I bought him; double I broke him myself.”</p>

<p>Some of the dealers are wits and most of them have quaint
expressions and sayings. The following sample will suffice:
A dealer was seen exercising a horse so badly foundered in
his hind feet that he not only walked on his heels but
stood with his fore and hind feet almost on the same spot
under his body. “Say! What are you goin’ to do with that
critter!” asked a bystander, and like a flash came the answer,
“Take him to Indiana to tramp sourkraut in a barrel.”</p>

<h3 id="heading42">The Winter Board Trick.</h3>

<p>A farmer read an advertisement in a city paper asking
for a winter home and board for two family horses that the
owner desired to leave comfortably provided for in the
country during his absence in Europe. The farmer went to
the city to investigate and found a fine pair of horses in a
swell stable. Soon a bargain, profitable to the farmer, was
arranged at a specified rate per week for board, stabling and
care during the winter, but as the pleased stranger was about
to leave for home, the stableman said, “Here, you are a
stranger to me, and therefore you ought to put up some
security for having such a valuable pair of horses in your
care.” After some discussion, the farmer was induced to
deposit $100 as security, and went home, congratulating himself
upon the good winter’s profit he would have in looking
after the horses which were to be shipped to him by train the
following day. In due course, two horses arrived, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
were old “plugs,” worth perhaps $5 a piece. The swindle
cost the farmer $90 and his expenses, for when he went to
the city to hunt up the sharper, he found the stable in the
same old place, but the bird had flown, and no one could tell
him where.</p>

<h3 id="heading43">How Horses Catch Cold.</h3>

<p>An old time farrier wisely says: “Many farmers and
tradesmen get too much drink when they go to market, and
then set off home, riding like madmen, and calling at some
public house on the road to get more of the <i>soul and body
destroying evil</i>, leave their horses to stand sweating at the
door, where it is no wonder that they get cold. Wagoners,
carters, and coal carriers, are also often guilty of this abominable
practise.”</p>

<h3 id="heading44">Tricks in Measuring Horses.</h3>

<p>It is often important to have a horse not less than some
given height, and great care has to be taken in making the
necessary measurement with the “hand stick” (hippometer).
If the horse is under or over the desired height the dealer
may irritate the animal so that an exact measurement is difficult
or impossible to make.</p>

<p>If the horse is undersized the dealer will try to stand him
with the hind feet low. In the stable or yard everything is
prepared so that this may be easily done. Another plan is
to put on abnormally thick shoes, or those having calkins; the
animal’s head is kept lowered so that the withers will be
correspondingly heightened. Opposite methods are practised
when a horse is a trifle too high for show-yard requirements
or mating, and such tricks have given buyers of horses for
the army no end of trouble.</p>

<p>When a horse is to be measured stand him on a level
floor and then see that the measuring is honestly done.</p>

<h2 id="Secrets_About_Stallion_Selling">Secrets About Stallion Selling.</h2>

<h3 id="heading45">Palming Off a Grade Stallion on a Company.</h3>

<p>The fact that several bogus pedigree registry associations
are in existence, although they have not received the approval
of the Department of Agriculture at Washington, makes it
possible for dishonest stallion peddlers to obtain fraudulent
registry certificates and, by using them, to fool the farmer. It
would be well if no registry associations were allowed to
engage in the interstate business of recording the pedigrees
of breeding animals without first obtaining the approval of
the Secretary of Agriculture.</p>

<p>A stallion whose sire was said by the owner to be
“Middleton II” and out of a dam of part Morgan blood, was
given a grade license certificate by the Department of Horse
Breeding, of the College of Agriculture, of the University of
Wisconsin. Some time later the horse changed hands and
the buyer, who was an experienced organizer of stallion
companies, had him recorded in a bogus stud book which
issues a handsome, gold sealed registry certificate. On this
the stallion was given an entirely new and wholly false
pedigree, the sire being set forth as “Grove Revenue” and the
dam as a well-bred Shire. On the strength of this attractive
registry certificate of notable ancestry and the help of a few
confederates, the stallion was sold to a company of hard-working
farmers in one of the northern counties of the state
for $1,800 in shares of $75 each. Some of the notes were discounted
and the peddler disappeared, but now the matter is
in the courts, as the Department of Horse Breeding discovered
the swindle and put the company “wise.”</p>

<p>Another case has been discovered where a grade stallion
was sold for a good price as pure-bred on the strength of a
registry certificate from the stud book alluded to and “imported”
according to the statement of the peddler. The owner
in this case also learned too late that he had fallen a victim
to sharpers, and will now seek redress in the courts.</p>

<p>Many similar cases could be cited and they serve to show
the importance of studying the registry certificate furnished
with the horse and making sure that it was issued by a stud
book association approved by the Department of Agriculture,
Washington, D. C.</p>

<h3 id="heading48">Story of a Company Stallion Deal.</h3>

<p>A few years ago a suit for the payment of fraudulently
obtained notes for the purchase of a stallion was thrown out
of court by Judge Carland, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, for
want of equity. A transcript of the evidence shows that
there were the best of reasons for the Judge’s action.</p>

<p>It was alleged by the defendants, a number of farmers,
that their names were secured in a book, by reason of representations
made by an agent of the horse importer that they
were signing a call for a meeting of farmers to consider the
matter of buying a stallion for $5,000, and that when twenty
names were secured a meeting would be called.</p>

<p>The names were secured and the meeting called, but
instead of being asked to consider the matter of buying the
horse the signers were informed that they had already agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to buy the horse and jointly and severally pay $5,000 for him in
four equal yearly payments, the first payment to be in two
years, with six per cent. interest on all payments. In a proof of
this it was shown that a brief contract in small type was
printed at the top of the page of the book in which the names
were signed which bound the signers as alleged. Upon this
revelation the meeting became the opposite of one called to
consider the purchase of the horse, as may be readily imagined.</p>

<p>The evidence shows that the defendants either did not
know there was any printing matter on the page they signed,
or if they did see it did not read it, and were told by the agent
that it had nothing to do with the matter under consideration,
or to be exact, one farmer testified: “I looked the thing over:
I noticed this contract at the head of it and I asked what
that fine print was there. He (the agent) said that it was
an Iowa contract and did not cut any figure in this State.”
Another explanation was testified to by another witness, quoted
further on. Some witnesses testified that a broad rubber
band or a turned leaf concealed the contract. The agent
testified that he did not call any of the defendants’ attention
to the contract, didn’t know if they saw it, but “supposed
they did, for they had the book in their hands.”</p>

<p>All the defendants testified that they would not have
signed the book if they had known the contract was there.
Regarding the matter of what the meeting was to be called
for, one farmer testified as follows, and he was corroborated
by the other witnesses for the defense, and by at least one
witness for the plaintiffs:</p>

<p>“Question: State what that conversation was, what he
(the agent) said and what you said.”</p>

<p>“Answer: He told me he was trying to sell a horse and
wanted me to sign a book. I asked the object of signing the
book and he said it was just to call a meeting and get the
men together and see if they would buy the horse. I asked
him why he wanted our names on the book if he just wanted
to call a meeting, why didn’t he call it without our names on
the book? Well, he says, you fellows are strangers to me,
your names are unfamiliar and I want a list of them so that
I will know who to notify when I get ready to call a meeting,
or else, he says, I may forget some of you who would like a
share in that horse. Then I asked if there was anything binding
about the book. I saw some printed matter and asked him
what that was and he said there was nothing binding about it.
I asked him what it was and what it was there for. He said
it was just a memorandum showing that the meeting was
called for, and the meeting would be to make a proposition
to us to sell the horse and if we seen fit to buy the horse, well
and good. If not, he said he would be out so much time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and no harm done. That is the sum and substance of the
conversation we had until I signed the book.”</p>

<p>It seems clear enough that the defendants believed they
were simply signing a call for a meeting to consider the
subject of forming a company to buy the horse; at any rate
the case seemed so clear to Judge Carland that he did not
seriously consider the question of compelling the farmers to
give their notes as demanded by the plaintiffs, and threw the
case out of court.</p>

<h3 id="heading49">Horse Peddlers’ Confessions.</h3>

<p>A peddler is a horse sharper who buys a cheap stallion
of questionable quality, soundness, prepotency or breeding,
from some large horse dealing firm, and then organizes a
company of farmers for his purchase at a handsome profit.
The tricks of such men are many and shady, and a few of
them are here quoted for the benefit of farmers, who being
thus forewarned, should in future be forearmed against the
wiles of these glib-tongued confidence men.</p>

<p>The “Farm, Stock and Home” vouches for the truth of the
following personal confession of a stallion peddler:</p>

<h3 id="heading50">The Sale of Les Epinards.</h3>

<p>I had noticed in a farm paper the advertisement of an
auction sale of Percheron horses to be held at the farm of a
breeder in an adjoining state. I slipped down there a few
days before the date of sale, and picked out a nice looking,
two-year-old stallion and on the day of sale bid $320 and the
horse was sold to me. A pedigree was thrown in, but as it
was written in the English language and the horse had a
common, pronounceable name, I discarded it and christened
him Les Epinards. At that time I didn’t know what Les
Epinards meant, but remembered having seen it somewhere.
I shipped him to a small town and started in to organize a
company to buy him for $2,800. The pedigree proposition
bothered me until I heard Billie was organizing a company
in the next county. He very kindly lent me a pedigree that
he had in his trunk which answered very well for Les Epinards.
It was natural for me to say that the Epinards were
celebrated breeders over in France who always named their
horses after themselves. The name and the horse made a
hit, and in six weeks’ time I had the signatures of ten farmers
each for $280, four of them good, and the others just well
enough known to the banker to cut down his discount 15<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
per cent. As it was a joint note, the banker realized in full
and I came out of the sale in this fashion:</p>

<p>Now that’s what Tummy would call “financial acumen.”
I bought a horse at an auction sale for $320, shipped him to
another county in the same state and sold him for $2,800. It
gradually dawned on me that there was more money in the
selling than there was in the breeding and raising. Tummy
was a wise boy, but I was beginning to learn a few things
myself.</p>

<p>The same paper published the following, October 1, 1905:</p>

<h3 id="heading51">The Sale of Transmigrator.</h3>

<p>The easy money I made on the sale of Les Epinards as
narrated in the last issue, emboldened me to try a new dodge.
A fair was being held in Winnipeg. While there I fell in
with a horse breeder who had a number of Percherons on his
farm, some distance to the east of that town. At his invitation
I visited the farm and was somewhat surprised at the
prices he quoted for fine-looking stallions. One two-year-old
of necessary size and shape he offered me for $300. It was
not any part of my business to tell him who I was, and I
am inclined to think he took me for a farmer from the states.
In the horse peddling business the less people know about
you the better and easier it is for the peddler, so I never
corrected him. I bought the horse, imported him across the
imaginary line dividing the two countries duty free by making
affidavit he was to be used exclusively for breeding purposes
and by satisfying the authorities with the pedigree furnished
me by the Canadian that he was a pure-bred animal.</p>

<p>With the rich selected feed my groom knew how to mix,
helped along with artistic grooming and care, Transmigrator—the
name he was to be known by—waxed fat and sleek. I
could truthfully say he was imported, but as he was a bit
shy on prize winnings I could not harp much on that score.
Blue ribbons were cheap, however, and when we decked him
out with a supply of them, he looked as fit as the majority of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
horses I sold for certain importers. Inasmuch as his pedigree
was written in English, and certified to by officials with easy
names to pronounce, I resolved to give the company a bargain,
and put his price at $2,500. I always did believe in being
generous. I might just as easily have sold for $3,000, but I
threw off $500 on account of the understandable pedigree.</p>

<p>The company which bought the horse came near going
to pieces after I had secured the names of six farmers to the
notes. A busybody in that community insisted on making
me a cash offer of $1,000. Of course, there was no profit in
that for me and I was perfectly right in refusing his offer.
What’s the use of farmers being educated to the beauties of
the company plan which benefits the bankers, the peddlers,
the groom, and the cappers, if we are going to sell the horse
direct for cash. It’s only the farmers that make the money
by the cash or direct way of buying a stallion. I never met a
peddler who was looking out for the farmers’ interests. They
are in the business to improve the quality of horses and
incidentally increase the size of their own bank rolls.</p>

<p>This reprobate even went so far as to actually buy a
stallion from a breeder for $975, and I must confess he was a
good judge, for he certainly got an excellent animal. My horse,
however, had one advantage—he had a longer name and was
imported. On two occasions I felt like quitting. Only four
of the signers of the joint note could be trusted for a peanut,
so the banker said, and he insisted on my getting two additional
names acceptable to him. This was not an agreeable
task, and I worked like a Trojan, persuading the members of
the company that it was a more sensible thing to sign notes
due in two years for $2,500 at only six per cent. interest
rather than to pay $1,000 cash for a horse that possibly might
die as soon as paid for. I will not repeat in cold print the
arguments I used—they might be considered foolish by my
readers. The fact remains, however, I did get six good names
on that note and four fillers, making ten signers, who each
agreed to pay me $250 for Transmigrator. They could
have bought a better horse for $1,000 cash from breeders,
within 100 miles. I made fair wages by the transaction, as
may be seen from the following:</p>

<h2 id="Some_Veterinary_Secrets">Some Veterinary Secrets.</h2>

<h3 id="heading52">Secret of Preventing Navel and Joint Disease.</h3>

<p>When a new-born foal speedily develops abscesses involving
the navel and the joints of the extremities, the cause is
an invasion of the navel by filth germs and this may easily
be prevented. A mare foaling in cold weather should be
provided with a clean, fresh bedded, disinfected, light, airy,
whitewashed box stall in which to have her foal. In the
summer season she may be allowed to foal on grass where
filth germs are less liable to be found than in old, dark, dirty
stables. But no matter where the foal is born, care must be
taken to thoroughly disinfect the navel cord (umbilicus) as
soon as it has been severed or tied. For this purpose a 1:500
solution of bichloride of mercury (corrosive sublimate) is
usually recommended, but we advise the use of a much
stronger solution to be prepared as follows: Dissolve ½
ounce of finely powdered corrosive sublimate in 1 pint of
boiling water to which has been added 1 dram of dilute
hydrochloric acid. When cold add ½ ounce of tincture of iron,
as coloring matter; label the bottle “poison” and keep it out
of the reach of children.</p>

<p>At the birth of a foal immediately wet the stump of the
navel with this solution and repeat the application twice
daily until the cord dries up, and falls off and no raw spot
can be seen. The solution at the time of using may conveniently
be held in a shallow wide-mouthed bottle into which the
stump of the cord may be inserted and immersed. As soon
as the cord has shrivelled up remove it, if it will come away
readily. The new raw surface can easily be got at with the
solution. Use of the solution will also tend to prevent leakage
of urine from the navel.</p>

<p>It is best to avoid, wherever possible, tying the navel
cord at birth. The natural way is for the cord to be broken
at birth, either when the foal is dropped or by the mare
rising, and so causing it to break by stretching it. When
this happens the walls of the fetal urinary passage (urachus),
the arteries and the vein of the umbilicus retract and close
the opening; whereas these vessels are liable to remain open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
for entrance of germs if the cord has been ligated, or cut off
and the ligature quickly removed, besides allowing the escape
of urine by way of the pervious urachus.</p>

<h3 id="heading53">Symptoms of Bad Teeth.</h3>

<p>In some old horses whose molar teeth are diseased or
irregular, perfect mastication of hay becomes impossible.
After the animal has chewed for a time, the teeth and tongue
tend to form a ball (bolus) of hay which is forced out of the
mouth instead of being swallowed. This is termed “quidding,”
and when it is seen it may be taken as an indication of the
need of a veterinary dentist with his instruments. In other
cases the partly masticated food is gathered in a pouch
between the molar teeth and cheek, and this can be plainly
seen and felt by the careful examiner. This pouch is sometimes
called the “granary,” and from the outside its presence
is indicated by an elongated tumor which has a doughy feel
when pressed with the finger.</p>

<p>When a diseased molar is present in the mouth, or when
a “granary” exists, there is a foul odor, which should lead to
the discovery of the condition. To distract attention from
this odor it is said that horse dealers always take the precaution
to cleanse the mouth of the horse with vinegar.</p>

<p>A chronic discharge from one nostril (nasal gleet),
accompanied by a fetid odor, should warn the buyer to make
a critical examination of the teeth, for if one is diseased and
is the cause of the discharge, it will have to be removed by
trephining, and that means expense and possibly loss of the
services of the horse for some time.</p>

<h3 id="heading54">Remedies for Tail Rubbing.</h3>

<p>Idle, overfed, and insufficiently groomed horses often
persistently rub their manes and tails to allay itchiness of
the skin, induced by collections of dandruff which have
escaped the curry-comb and brush. The hair on the root
of the tail soon becomes harsh, stubby and stands on end
so that the part becomes an eyesore, and especially so when
continued rubbing has produced sores, cracks and an exudate
of serum, blood or pus.</p>

<p>A Virginia horseman once advised the writer that tail
rubbing could quickly be cured if, at the outset, the following
simple plan of treatment be adopted: Twist a lock of the
upright hair of the affected part around the second finger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and then pull until the skin “gives” with a cracking sound.
Repeat the pulling, lock by lock, until all of the part has been
treated when the rubbing will cease. If it does not do so
promptly, repeat the treatment as required. This plan is
known also in Scotland.</p>

<p>Another horseman advised that when a mare persistently
rubs her tail the cause may be a collection of filth about the
udder; a thorough washing with castile soap will end the
trouble.</p>

<p>Dealers who handle fine carriage horses and are preparing
such animals for sale put each in a box stall during the feeding
process and prevent tail rubbing by putting a wide plank
shelf-wise on brackets around the inside of the walls of the
box. When the horse attempts to rub, the edge of the plank
will strike several inches below the itching part, and so make
tail rubbing impossible. Another effective plan of prevention
is to put a wainscot of boards upon the lower part of the
walls so slanted outward at the floor surface that the horse
backing to the wall cannot get his rump against any surface
upon which to rub.</p>

<h3 id="heading55">A Cruel Cure for Heaves.</h3>

<p>An old horseman once told the writer that he had cured
many a horse of heaves by simply amputating a portion of
the tongue. “Guess I’ve cut off enough pieces of tongue,”
said he, “to fill a half bushel basket;” and he seemed to take
pride in a statement which would strike any humanitarian as
the climax of barbarity. The same man also strongly advocated
the amputation of the tip of a horse’s tail, when for any
reason the animal had gone down paralyzed.</p>

<p>It always is well to examine a horse’s tongue before
buying, as mutilations are not infrequently met with. Cases
are on record where a brute has put a twitch on a horse’s
tongue, to make him stand still in the shoeing shop, with the
result that a portion of the organ has been torn off during
the struggles of the poor beast. Severe biting of a fractious
horse, or tearing by a nail or other sharp object, may also
injure the tongue more or less severely and perhaps lessen
the value of the animal.</p>

<p>When a considerable portion of the tongue has been
lost, the horse is unable to drink without plunging his head
up to the eyes in the water, and he also has difficulty in
grazing.</p>

<p>Stitches are sometimes put in the tongue of a horse to
make it sore and so prevent it from cribbing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading56">An Astringent for Scours.</h3>

<p>The following interesting remedy is taken from the “Complete
Farrier,” published in 1850:</p>

<p>“But when the disorder (a scouring) continues, and the
horse’s flesh keeps wasting away, recourse must be had to
astringents. Tormentil root, dried and pounded in a mortar,
and put through a sieve, is one of the best astringents yet
found, though very little known. I heartily wish my fellow
creatures would make more use of this valuable root than
they do. The dose is from an ounce to an ounce and a half.
I believe that this valuable root has done more good in my
time, in stopping looseness and other bowel complaints, than
anything else.”</p>

<h3 id="heading57">An Old Operation for Spavin.</h3>

<p>A few years ago it was recommended as a new treatment
that the saphena vein be obliterated at the place where it
passes the seat of spavin, before using the firing irons. We
recently ran across an allusion to this method of treatment
which shows that it is by no means new. It is referred to as
follows in the “Complete Farrier and Horse Doctor,” published
in 1850, the writer being John C. Knowlson, of New
York, a nonagenarian “horse doctor” of the old school:
“Before you fire a horse for bone-spavin, be careful to take
the vein out of the way, for it generally lies over the spavin,
and you cannot fire deep enough to come at the callous
substance without its removal. In order to destroy the vein,
cut a nick through the skin to the vein, just below the spavin,
and another just above it, and put a crooked needle under
the vein and tie both ends: then cut the vein across between
the tyings, both above and below, and you may either draw
out the piece or leave it in.”</p>

<p>The same author says relative to the treatment of bog-spavin:
“As soon as you discover the vein puffed up or
forming a bag, lay on some blistering ointment, and in four
days after bathe the swelling well with hot vinegar with a
little saltpeter dissolved in it. Also put a bandage round it
to disperse the swelling as much as you can. If this method
does not succeed, you must make two incisions in the skin
lengthwise, as the vein runs, one just above and the other
just below the joint, and lay the vein bare: then put the end
of a buck’s horn under it, raise it up, and fasten it in both
places with waxed thread; then cut the vein in two just within
the tyings, and, if you think proper, draw the severed piece
out. This method of proceeding will cure most bog-spavins
at the beginning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading58">Facts About Pigment Tumors.</h3>

<p>On gray horses that at 10 or 12 years of age are turning
white in color, purple-black malignant growths, known as
pigment of melanotic tumors, frequently appear where the
skin is black in color, and constitute the disease termed
melanosis. The common seat of such tumors is the skin of the
tail, anus, vulva, and lips, and while most often external, may
be present internally. Such tumors are practically incurable,
returning after having been amputated and cauterized. They
usually burst and discharge bloody pus, and give the affected
part a loathsome appearance. In young horses of gray color,
a careful examination will often disclose small rudimentary
tumors, and horses so affected should be bought with a right
understanding of the consequences. Fatal attacks of a mysterious
disease may be caused by internal melanotic tumors.</p>

<p>As an indication of the probability of these tumors being
present internally, the French veterinary scientists, Goubaux
and Barrier, say in their “Exterior of the Horse”:</p>

<p>“The hairs of the mane, like those of the tail, are ordinarily
straight. One of our associates, Mercier, has communicated
a remark on this subject, which was also believed by the
Arabians: that it is in the white or gray horses with <i>frizzled</i>
or <i>curly</i> hairs in which melanotic tumors are always found in
the interior of the body, although none may have any apparent
trace on the exterior, particularly under the tail and around
the anus. This remark, the correctness of which we have
verified a number of times, both on the living subject and in
the cadaver, is very important, because of the dangers to which
animals affected with melanosis are exposed.”</p>

<h2 id="Secrets_of_Buying_and_Selling_Horses">Secrets of Buying and Selling Horses.</h2>

<h3 id="heading59">Auction Sale Rules.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></h3>

<p>At the Chicago Stock-yards the auction sales of horses,
conducted in the “Bull ring,” at Dexter Park, are regulated by
certain definite rules which should be understood by horsemen
and farmers.</p>

<p>When a horse is brought in for sale a sign stating how the
horse is to be sold is immediately exposed on the auctioneer’s
rostrum. There are six of these signs, viz., (1) Sound.
(2) Serviceably sound. (3) Wind and work. (4) Work only.
(5) Legs go. (6) At the halter.</p>

<p>Terms on all sales are strictly cash.</p>

<p>All horses must be examined and tried by purchaser as
soon as bought, and must be tried and accepted on the premises
during the day of sale, as all guarantees on horses expire with
that day, and on delivery of the horse. In no case can a horse
be rejected except on the day of sale, unless sold as sound and
proved to be a cribber, heavey, crampy or lame. If proven to
have any of the four named faults, the purchaser shall have
until 9 A. M. the following day to reject the horse. Purchasers
failing to try and examine horses within the required time
forfeit all right of rejecting them, and no horse sold to wind
and work shall be rejected for any cause except he proves
windy or will not work.</p>

<p>Should any question arise for adjustment between buyer
and seller the matter shall be referred to three members of
the Union Stock-yards Horse Exchange, the decision of a
majority of whom shall be final.</p>

<p>Any person found guilty of doping a horse to hide the
fact that the animal is windy, heavey, crampy, cribby or lame,
shall be expelled from the market and prosecuted to the full
extent of the law.</p>

<p>The following is an explanation of the principal rules
governing sales in the auction ring:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p><b>1. Sound.</b>—A horse sold as sound must be perfectly
sound in every way.</p>

<p><b>2. Serviceably Sound.</b>—Must be virtually a sound horse.
His wind and eyes must be good: he must not be lame or sore
in any way, but sound, barring slight blemishes, and these
blemishes must not constitute any unsoundness. A spot or
streak in the eye, which does not affect the sight, will be
considered serviceably sound as long as the pupil of the eye is
good. A further explanation is given as follows by F. J. Berry
&amp; Co., a well-known horse commission firm at the Chicago
Stock-yards: “Blemishes must be nothing more than splints;
the horse may be slightly puffed and a little rounding on the
curb joint, but he must not have a bad-looking curb, and must
not have a brand. He may be a little cut in the knees, but
he must not stand over on the knees or ankles. He may have
a little puff on the outside of the hock, but he must not have
thoroughpin, or boggy-hock, ringbone, or jack, although he
may naturally be a little coarse jointed; but the front part of
the hocks inside must not be puffed. He may have slight scars
or wire marks but these must not cause any deformity of the
body, legs or feet, and must be nothing more than a slight
scar. He must not have any scar from fistula or poll-evil. He
must not have a hip down, and if one hip is a trifle lower than the
other, it must be natural, and not a deformity like the cap of
a hip down. He must not have side-bone, or any bad blemishes
that deteriorate his value more than a trifle, but must be sound,
barring slight blemishes that do not hurt him or change his
value very little, and in no case more than the above-mentioned
blemishes. Car bruises must be of a temporary nature.”</p>

<p><b>3. Wind and Work.</b>—A horse sold to wind and work,
must have good wind and be a good worker, and not a cribber,
but everything else goes with him.</p>

<p><b>4. Work Only.</b>—He must be a good worker, but everything
else goes with him. Ability to work is the only thing
guaranteed.</p>

<p><b>5. Legs Go.</b>—Everything that is on the horse’s legs go
with him. Nothing is guaranteed except that he must not be
lame or crampy. He must, however, be serviceably sound in
every other respect.</p>

<p><b>6. At the Halter.</b>—Sold just as he stands without any
recommendations. He may be lame, vicious, balky, a kicker
or anything else. The title only is guaranteed; the purchaser
takes all the risk.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Exceptions to the above rules may be announced from the auction stand and defects
pointed out, in which case they are recorded and go with the horse.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="heading60">Reputable Dealers Protect Their Patrons.</h3>

<p>The horse buyer who patronizes a reputable commission
firm or dealer in the Chicago horse market, or in any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
great selling centre, will be honestly and fairly dealt with. The
rules against cheating are stringent, and trickery is not countenanced
among the leaders of the trade. Doping an unsound
horse may be punished by expulsion from the market, and
tricks, like the application of “soup” to make a horse act mean,
are prohibited on “horse row.” It is when a buyer deals with
a “scalper” who conducts his business “under his hat,” or
patronizes the dealers who conduct a questionable business at
small sales stables on the side streets near the stock-yards,
that he may expect to get “the short end of the deal,” and we
would strongly advise our readers to give such dealers and
sales stables a wide berth.</p>

<p>As an illustration of how dishonesty is regarded among
horsemen in some of the markets, the following well-authenticated
incident may be told. In Kansas City a horse that had
been overdosed with drugs to conceal the symptoms of heaves
dropped dead while climbing an incline. The story of the
“accident” spread through the market, and the next morning,
when the owner of the drugged horse offered another of his
animals in the auction ring, the auctioneer is said to have
stopped, told the story to the audience, pointed out the man
who gave the drugs and the owner, and added, “Now, this
man has a load of horses to sell to-day and you folks can be
your own judges about buying them.”</p>

<p>The seller from the country is as likely to “put up a job”
on the commission man or dealer as the latter is to cheat the
greenhorn buyer, and we agree with Dr. Hawley, who says:
“Horsemen in general are not more dishonest than men in
any other branch of business which offers like opportunities
for trickery; neither do I believe they are more dishonest
than the men who buy from them.”</p>

<h3 id="heading61">Two Sides to a Horse.</h3>

<p>When a horse is first led out for the intending buyer to
examine him in the dealer’s stable, it is a common trick to
stand the animal close against a wall. By this means objectionable
features of the “other side of the picture” are hidden,
and the pleasing aspects of the proposition, plain to the eye
and hand of the purchaser, alone are considered by him in
making his choice. If the horse is sold subject to such
examination and without a written guaranty, there is no
recourse for the purchaser when, perchance, the next hour or
day he finds on the off side of the horse a “wall-eye,” a brand
mark, a big shoe boil, a knocked-down hip, a fistula of the
withers, or some other objectionable and troublesome or even
seriously hurtful blemish or condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>The intending purchaser should get the horse away from
the wall and make a tour of inspection around him, looking
carefully at every part and detail, and then using the hand,
if necessary, to corroborate or correct what the eye has seen
or suspected. It is always best to look at the horse from a
little distance before closing in, and making a more careful
inspection. Close inspection deals with minute things, and
may make one overlook or fail to see bigger and more important
things which would appeal to the eye when taking in the
entire side of the horse at a look.</p>

<p>When a dealer is extra particular to draw attention to one
side of the animal, take it for granted that there is something
on the other side which is worth looking into.</p>

<h3 id="heading62">A Little Ill to Distract Attention from a Big One.</h3>

<p>Often we have seen tricks such as the following practised
in the “bull ring” at the stock-yards. A horse having a small
spot or speck in its eye which does not implicate the pupil, is
sold to “wind and work” (<a href="#Page_50">See Auction rule No. 3, page 50</a>).</p>

<p>The grooms and ringmen loudly draw the attention of
the audience to the condition of the eye, and repeatedly assert
that it does not amount to anything. This is done on purpose
to distract attention from some far more serious defect that
otherwise would be noticed by the prospective buyer. Dr.
Hawley says of this scheme, “The horse is kept constantly in
motion with the whip. The auctioneer and salesman are always
looking for an angel to drop in, and one usually does. The
horse is ordinarily sold to the angel on his first bid.”</p>

<h3 id="heading63">Beware of Hoof Dressing.</h3>

<p>When the hoofs of a sale horse are seen to be newly
daubed with black hoof dressing, polish, or varnish, look out!
or rather, look in! for there may be vital need of the artificial
coating to hide serious defects. The dressing, if wet, will soil
the examiner’s hands, hence he will be less likely to handle
the feet and therefore fails to discover that a quarter crack or
sand crack has been concealed, or the fact that the hoof has
been rasped extensively for the removal of the rings and ridges
that if exposed to the notice of the prospective buyer, would
tell a plain story of chronic founder.</p>

<p>The sound, healthy, waxy appearing hoof needs no coloring
or dressing material, and when such things are freely used
they are often applied to hide the marks of the rasp.</p>

<h3 id="heading64">Buying a Pair.</h3>

<p>While a properly matched and trained pair of carriage
horses should “act like one horse” when in motion, the buyer
should be careful to examine each horse carefully “to halter.”
The two animals should be capable of being harnessed to the
carriage indifferently to the right or left, and no attention
should be paid to the observations of the dealer, who may
explain how they have been accustomed to be driven always
on the same side, and who, as a rule, will harness the better
one of the two horses on the left side, and the poorer one on
the right. The examiner naturally pays most attention to the
left horse, but he should examine each in a thorough manner,
for it often happens when this is done that one horse is found
to be of far inferior quality and of less value than its mate, on
the “nigh side.”</p>

<h3 id="heading65">A “High English” Guaranty.</h3>

<p>A thrifty German truck farmer once called the writer to
examine a newly bought work horse and to give him “a line”
so that he would be able to get his money back from the dealer,
the animal having proved unsound. “I have me a written
guaranty and a witness that he been all right,” said he, “and
now you help me oudt mit a line.” An examination showed
that the horse was terribly afflicted with heaves, accompanied
with coughing and passing of gas. He heaved so hard that his
entire body shook, and the squeaking of the breathing apparatus
was easily heard. Evidently the horse had been skilfully
“shut” or doped by the seller, and now that the effects of the
treatment had passed off the unsoundness showed up plainly.
Asked for his “guaranty,” the farmer kept iterating and
reiterating his statement that it was all right and duly witnessed.
At last he produced it, and it read to this effect, “This horse is
hereby guaranteed free from all encumbrances.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what ‘encumbrances’ means?” he was asked,
and the answer was, “No, I don’t know such high English
words, but I guess it means sound and all righdt in wint and
limb, and to work, aind’t it?”</p>

<p>He got his “line,” and by paying $80 to boot brought
back another horse with a less comprehensive but more satisfactory
guaranty.</p>

<p>Moral: It is best to understand “high English” and the
language and ways of the dealer when buying a horse at the
yards, so that a written guaranty may really protect the buyer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="heading66">An Unsound Horse Sometimes a Good Bargain.</h3>

<p>Some kinds of unsoundness render a horse useless for work
on the hard streets of the city, yet do not unfit him for work
on the soft land of the farm. Where this is the case, it will
often pay the farmer whose pocketbook is not particularly well
filled to pass by the young, soft, untried, expensive horses that
have been specially fattened to bring high prices and buy a
second-handed horse at a bargain price.</p>

<p>For example, suppose a big, strong gelding, getting along
in years, has four well-developed side-bones which render
him stilty and stiff in gait for city use, and which on that
account is offered for $80, or thereabout. Such a horse may
prove a profitable purchase for use on the land. Were he
sound he would sell readily for $125 or over, for city work,
and when bought at a discount of $45 he will very likely do
more and better work on the farm than would a sound, young,
fattened, inexperienced horse at the higher figure.</p>

<p>In making this statement the writer has in mind more
than one corroborative instance of the sort in practise.</p>

<h3 id="heading67">A Second-Hand Horse.</h3>

<p>The owner who wants to sell his horse on the market
should not clip off the mane and forelock, and it is a mistake
even to cut the latter or to bang the tail. The stock-yard
buyers, having special market requirements to meet, prefer to
do their own “toilet work” on the horses they buy, and will
pass by an otherwise good horse if he has been trimmed in
a manner to which they object.</p>

<p>A horse that has had the mane and forelock clipped off is
looked upon with suspicion on arrival at the market, and is
likely to be termed “second-hand,” meaning that he probably
has been tried out in a fire department and found wanting. It
is therefore disastrous policy to “roach” a horse before he has
been thoroughly tested and found sound and suitable.</p>

<p>Here is a case corroborative of this assertion: A fine
gelding was bought for a fire department after a fairly thorough
test for “wind.” While being led a long distance behind a
sulky from the country to the city the horse became fractious
and broke away from the driver. On arrival in the city he was
immediately taken to the engine-house and met with the
unanimous approval of the fire laddies and chief. The next
morning the mane and foretop were clipped off and the horse
was then sent out for a practise run. At once he proved
terribly nervous and a rank roarer when in motion, but
perfectly sound in wind the moment he stood at ease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>The commissioner who bought the horse at once took him
back, refunded the purchase price, and sent him to the stock-yards.
There he was instantly dubbed “second-handed”; ran up
a bill of expense for his owner who could not find a buyer and
finally contracted stock-yards distemper in virulent form.
Eventually the animal was sold for less than half the purchase
price and expense account, but not until the mane had grown
in again sufficiently to disarm suspicion. Removing the mane
or foretop will be certain to detract from the value of the
horse in the market.</p>

<h3 id="heading68">“Protecting” the Buyer.</h3>

<p>In some sales-stables, when a coachman commissioned by
a rich layman to purchase a single horse, or match a pair in his
behalf, has stated his needs, looked over a few animals, and
hinted at what he can afford to pay, he is asked by the dealer:
“How much shall I protect you?” That means how much
commission will you expect if the deal is consummated; and
the coachman is not slow to ask a handsome rake-off. Another
plan of making a profit, is to get as low a price or option as
possible from the dealer, and then add a profit by having the
seller charge a higher price than the option and afterward hand
the balance to the buyer’s agent. Unless the commissioner
is paid a special fee by his employer for making the purchase,
these methods of making living wages for the work involved
in the deal are considered perfectly legitimate by men connected
with the horse markets.</p>

<h3 id="heading69">Splitting the Profit Three Ways.</h3>

<p>In the great horse markets, when a gentleman’s coachman,
or a man who is deemed by him to be an expert judge, is
commissioned to buy a certain style of horse at not over a
stated price, the expert can easily arrange to make a double
profit. He seeks out some scalper friend, and gives him a
detailed description of the sort of horse wanted. The scalper
then visits the stable of his associates in the business, selects a
horse that “looks like the job” and secures an option on him
at a price considerably lower than the buyer has said he will
be willing to pay. He now brings in the expert, and if the
horse suits that worthy, he is purchased at the option price
and turned over to the employer of the expert at his specified
price or a trifle less. Then the scalper and the expert divide the
profit, or if another man “on the inside” has been used in the
deal, the profit is “split three ways,” to give him a slice. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
buyer is usually well satisfied with his bargain, and probably
could not have bought the horse cheaper at first hand.</p>

<h3 id="heading70">A Glossary of Market Terms.</h3>

<p>In each of the great horse markets of the country certain
technical, trade and slang terms are used in speaking of horses,
and the intending buyer will do well to familiarize himself
with them, else he may learn their meaning by dear-bought
experience. In preparing the following glossary many of
the terms explained are such as one hears in the Chicago
market and elsewhere, and the writer has also freely quoted
from an article entitled, “The Veterinary Horse Buyer,” from
the pen of Dr. H. W. Hawley, V. S., in the Chicago Veterinary
College “Quarterly Bulletin” for June, 1903, and from Bulletin
No. 122 of the Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station, in
which Prof. Rufus C. Obrecht deals elaborately and instructively
with the subject of “Market Classes and Grades of
Horses and Mules.” In many instances it has been thought
well to explain technical matters relating to practical subjects
as well as to interpret the special term used by horsemen.</p>

<p><b>A Bull.</b>—If a horse grunts when stood against a wall and
threatened with a stick or whip, he is called a bull (or grunter)
and by many is considered unsound in wind, or a roarer. The
test is not conclusive, as not all roarers grunt and many sound
horses grunt when so treated, or even when the rider places
his foot in the stirrup. It is also used to describe a wind-broken
horse that chokes at work. A heavey horse does not
grunt when tested in the above mentioned manner.</p>
